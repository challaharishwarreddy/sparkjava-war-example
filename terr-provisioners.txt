Terraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.

Terraform requires some sort of database to map Terraform config to the real world. For example, when you have a resource resource "aws_instance" "foo" in your configuration, Terraform uses this mapping to know that the resource resource "aws_instance" "foo" represents a real world object with the instance ID i-abcd1234 on a remote system.
